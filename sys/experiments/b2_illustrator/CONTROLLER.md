# Experimental project controller — current status

Production is unchanged; live generation remains disabled. Do not interpret local
unit tests as acceptance of reference conditioning, image quality or batch work.

## Browser connection

Executable `/opt/google/chrome/google-chrome`, primary profile
`/home/hongphuoc/.config/google-chrome/Profile 10`.

A live probe on 2026-09-21 showed that an existing CDP connection could create a
new tab under Profile 102 despite earlier successful Profile 10 probes. Therefore
connection reuse alone is insufficient. The controller now verifies exact profile
and executable on a probe tab, retains that same tab and uses it for subsequent
inspection. It refuses closed/navigated tabs rather than silently replacing them.
This preserves tool state and avoids repeated new-tab profile selection.

Verified live after the change: connect returned exact Profile 10, followed by two
successful inspections on the retained tab without a new connection. Evidence:
`results/bound-tab-inspect.json` and `results/bound-tab-inspect-reused.json`.
This proves the observed sequence, not all possible Chrome profile-switch behavior.

Use one `session.mjs serve`, followed by `connect`, `inspect`, `status`, `stop`.
The Unix socket is owner-only; commands are serialized. Chrome may request Allow
when a new CDP connection is established. There is no automatic retry after denial
or disconnect. Do not run standalone controller inspect alongside this service.
Client commands now have a timeout and return failure exit status for blocked work.

## Implemented checks

- Local preparation with content identity and preservation of existing records.
- Persistent verified-tab inspection with exact executable/profile checks.
- `check_contract.mjs`: read-only audit of required visible controls.
- `validate_asset.py`: decode actual bytes, validate MIME/ratio and measure real
  dimensions; report visual review separately as pending.

Latest actual UI audit: Style control is missing. Real reference conditioning,
model availability, per-generation credit cost and result recovery are unverified.
The original B-2 image passes technical 16:9 tolerance at JPEG 1376×768; it is not
an output of the custom tool and is not proof of continuity or new tool quality.

## Remaining integration

Wire the durable attempt store into a live adapter only after the contract in
CONTRACT.md is satisfied. Needed: source snapshots/narrow tool corrections, actual
reference selection evidence, immediate mediaId capture, collection/reconciliation,
then bounded queue tests and real Antigravity execution. No production integration
or claim of Antigravity handshake has been made.

The session currently supports connection/inspection commands only. It does not
submit editor changes, generate images, collect results or run batches. Updating
session command handlers requires restarting the service and a new Chrome consent.

## Storage budget and profile rotation (2026-09-24)

- queue-runner measures the tool origin's whole localStorage before each dispatch and sends only
  as many images as fit under 80 % of 5,242,880 chars (estimate: max(360,000, 1.15 x largest item)).
  When the rest does not fit it collects the finished chunk to disk, then compacts (backup in
  `results/controller/tool-state/`), exactly under the old `toolStateBlockers` rule.
- "Persistence failure after result" is a storage failure (image generated, not saved): never a
  no-media retry; it blocks compaction until reconciled.
- Out of quota (Flow error, no image; patterns in `profile-rotation.mjs`, extendable through
  `failure_patterns.quota`): the attempt is journaled `failed_no_media` with evidence, the profile is
  recorded in `results/controller/profile-exhaustion.json` until next local midnight, and, when
  `automatic_account_switching` is true, the unanswered requests are resent (new attempt,
  `identity.resend`) on the next profile in `priority` that has a `tool_url`. Every decision is
  appended to `results/controller/profile-switches.ndjson`. CAPTCHA, sign-in, storage and unknown
  errors still stop the queue; the switch never signs in or types anything.
- queue-runner is cached in the session process: restart the session to load these changes.
- A foreign `based_on` image can be uploaded into the next profile only when its saved
  bytes match the original generated-result bytes in the attempt journal. The transfer
  journal records the original media ID, target profile, uploaded media ID, network/UI
  agreement and a screenshot. It is checked before any pending generation is enqueued.
  Missing proof or an interrupted upload stops the queue for reconciliation; a plain
  image upload is not treated as a registered Character. The Flow upload selector and
  response/tile ID extraction have not had a live acceptance run on the next profile.
